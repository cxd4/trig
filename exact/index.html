<p>My current research summaries of the sines, co-sines, tangents, co-secants, secants, and co-tangents of each tested angle measure:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="sin0.xml">0 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin3.xml">3 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin6.xml">6 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin9.xml">9 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin15.xml">15 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin18.xml">18 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin30.xml">30 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin36.xml">36 degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="sin45.xml">45 degrees</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The above documents were generated with LibreOffice Math as MathML (.mml) files, but they are renamed to have a .xml extension simply for in-line rendering with browsers that support the format.  Anything Trident- or WebKit-based (such as Internet Explorer or Chromium/Chrome) is unlikely to ever render them correctly, so try opening their links with a browser from under the Mozilla family, such as FireFox.</p>
